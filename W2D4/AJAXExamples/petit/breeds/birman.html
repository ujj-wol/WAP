<h2>Birman</h2>

<p>The Birman is a domestic cat breed. Also known as "Sacred Cat of Burma" (particularly so in some languages), it is not to be confused with the Burmese (cat), which is a separate and dissimilar breed. The Birman has a pale coloured body and darker points with deep blue eyes. The Birman breed is recognized by the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA).</p>

<p>The Birman cat is said to have originated in Burma, where it was considered a sacred companion cat of the Kittah priests. There is a legend (retold in various forms) as to how the Birmans developed their modern coloration: Originally, the guardians of the Temple of LaoTsun were yellow-eyed white cats with long hair. The golden goddess of the temple, Tsun-Kyan-Kse, had deep blue eyes. The head priest, Mun-Ha, had as his companion a beautiful cat named Sinh. One day the temple was attacked and Mun-Ha was killed. At the moment of his death, Sinh placed his feet on his master. The catÂ’s white fur took on a golden cast; his eyes turned as blue as the eyes of the goddess, and his face, legs and tail became the color of earth. However, his paws, where they touched the priest, remained white as a symbol of purity. All the other temple cats became similarly colored. Seven days later, Sinh died, taking the soul of Mun-Ha to paradise.</p>

<p>The more recent history of the Birman is almost as shrouded in mystery as its legendary origin. What is known for certain is that the breed appeared around 1920 in France. One story goes that around 1919, a pair of Birman cats was clandestinely shipped from Burma to France. The male cat did not survive the arduous journey but the female, Sita, survived and happily, was pregnant.</p>
