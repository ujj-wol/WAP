<h2>Collie</h2>

<p>A collie is a distinctive type of herding dog, ultimately originating in Britain, especially in the upland areas of the north and west. It is a medium-sized, fairly lightly-built dog with a pointed snout, and many types have a distinctive white pattern over the shoulders. Collies are very active and agile, and most types have a very strong herding instinct. The collie type has spread through many parts of the world (especially Australia and North America) and has diversified into many landraces and breeds, sometimes with mixture from other dog types. Some of the collie types have remained working dogs, used for herding cattle, sheep and other livestock, while others are kept as pets, show dogs or for dog sports, in which they display great agility, stamina and trainability.</p>

<p>Common use of the name "collie" in some areas is limited largely to certain breeds such as to the Rough Collie in the United States, or to the Border Collie in many rural parts of Great Britain. Many collie types do not actually include "collie" in their name.</p>
