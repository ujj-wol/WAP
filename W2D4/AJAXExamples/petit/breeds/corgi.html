<h2>Corgi</h2>

<p>The Welsh Corgi is a type of small herding dog that originated in Wales. Two distinct breeds have been recognized: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi, with the Pembroke being the more common. Corgis are healthy dogs, living into their early or middle teens; however, both suffer from a few hereditary diseases. The most famous Welsh Corgis in the world are perhaps those of Her Majesty Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, who keeps at least four Corgis in her retinue at all times.</p>
<p>Corgis are herding dogs and perform their duties by nipping at the heels of the animals being herded; the dog's low stature allows him to avoid being kicked in the process. The Cardigan Welsh Corgi and the Pembroke Welsh Corgi were interbred until 1934 when the American Kennel Club then recognized them as two distinct and separate breeds. Welsh folklore says the Corgi is the preferred mount of fairy warriors.</p>
