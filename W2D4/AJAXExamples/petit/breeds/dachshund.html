<h2>Dachshund</h2>

<p>The Dachshund is a short-legged, elongated dog breed of the hound family. The breed's name is German and literally means "badger dog", from [der] Dachs, "badger", and [der] Hund, "dog". Due to the long, narrow build, they are sometimes referred to as a wiener dog or a sausage dog. Not withstanding the German origin of the dachshund's name, within German-speaking countries, the breed is known both formally and informally as the Dackel or Teckel. While classified as a hound in English-speaking countries, some consider the classification to be in error, speculating that it arose from the fact that the German word Hund is similar to the English word hound. In fact, many dachshunds, especially the wire-haired sub type, exhibit behavior and appearance that are far more similar to that of the terrier group of dogs. The standard size was developed to scent, chase, and flush badgers and other burrow-dwelling animals, while the miniature was developed to hunt rabbits.</p>
