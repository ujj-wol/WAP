<p>The Pug is a small breed of dog with a wrinkly, short muzzled face . The word "pug" may have come from the Old English pugg or "puge", which were affectionate terms for a playful little devil or monkey. Pug puppies are often called puglets. The breed is often summarized as multum in parvo ("much in little"), describing the Pug's remarkable personality despite its small size.</p>
