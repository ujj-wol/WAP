<h2>Shar Pei</h2>

<p>The Shar Pei or Chinese Shar-Pei is a breed of dog known for its distinctive features of deep wrinkles and a blue-black tongue. The breed derives from China. The name (??, pinyin: sha pí; English name probably derived from British spelling of Cantonese equivalent sa pèih) translates to "sand skin," and refers to the texture of its short, rough coat. As puppies, Shar Pei have numerous wrinkles, but as they mature, these wrinkles disappear as they "grow into their skin". Shar Pei were once named as one of the world's rarest dog breeds by Time magazine and the Guinness Book of World Records, and the American Kennel Club did not recognize the breed until 1991.</p>

<p>The origin of the Chinese Shar-Pei can be traced to the province of Kwun Tung and has for centuries existed in the southern provinces of China. These dogs helped their peasant masters in various tasks such as herding cattle, guarding the home and family, and have proven themselves to be qualified hunters of wild game, usually wild pigs, and, of course they were used for generations as fighting dogs, by the Chinese nobility, although the practice became rarer after the people's Revolution when such activities were seen as the preserve of the decadent classes.</p>
