<h2>Snowshoe</h2>

<p>The Snowshoe is a rare and relatively new[1] breed of cat originating in the United States of America. Snowshoes were first seen in Philadelphia, when a breeder's Siamese cat gave birth to three kittens with the pattern. The breeder, Dorothy Hinds-Daugherty, began to promote the cat and began a breeding program for them. When Hinds-Daugherty left the program, Vikki Olander began working with the cats and recruited new breeders, as well as working towards for full recognition with cat associations. Despite having existed for 45 years, Snowshoes are rare due to the difficulty of reproducing exactly the coat markings. These are based on recessive genes for the color points and on the co-dominant but variably-expressed piebald pattern gene, making it difficult to predict the appearance of offspring.</p>
